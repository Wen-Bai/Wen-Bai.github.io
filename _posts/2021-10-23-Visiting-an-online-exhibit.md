**Title: Impression of online exhibits**

Today I went on a [virtual tour](https://artsandculture.google.com/streetview/the-natural-history-museum-hintze-hall/yQHjHCmSOMKyhQ?sv_lng=-0.1763002033314968&sv_lat=51.49614943214926&sv_h=328.26907700203446&sv_p=21.747201048821324&sv_pid=xCOPaa20DC3Z4eRiKDUyew&sv_z=1) at [Natural History Museum virtual museum](http://nhm.ac.uk/visit/virtual-museum.html). The site is supported a third-party platform Google Arts & Culture and provides an interactive gigapixel photo that I can zoom in to see the details of the museum, which is amazing and free me from going to the museum in person. 


Through visiting the virtual museum, I was attracted by the [blue whale](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/bluewhale/) suspended from the ceiling in Hintze Hall and an online interactive was built for it. I was quite impressed by the realistic background sound to enhance the immediacy and I can easily explore the whale by selecting an icon. The interactive has 3 sections: what her life was like [in the ocean](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/bluewhale/ocean/), how she got to her home in the [the Hintze Hall](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/bluewhale/hall/) and behind-the-scenes peek of the [Museum's collections](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/bluewhale/study/).I leanrned that the whale is a female who beached in 1891 and it took experts months to construct a new armature and position the whale in its new diving posture. What's more, I can view the skeleton in [augmented reality (AR)](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/GAG_J9wcz31GXw), which makes me grateful for the digital technologies that prolong the life of these collections and give us access to this spectacular archieve.
