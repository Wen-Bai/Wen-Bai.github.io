title: Impression of online exhibits.

Today I went on a [virtual tour](https://artsandculture.google.com/streetview/the-natural-history-museum-hintze-hall/yQHjHCmSOMKyhQ?sv_lng=-0.1763002033314968&sv_lat=51.49614943214926&sv_h=328.26907700203446&sv_p=21.747201048821324&sv_pid=xCOPaa20DC3Z4eRiKDUyew&sv_z=1) at [Natural History Museum virtual museum](http://nhm.ac.uk/visit/virtual-museum.html). The site is supported by Google Arts & Culture and provides an interactive gigapixel photo that I can zoom in to see the details of the museum. I was attracted by the blue whale suspended from the ceiling in Hintze Hall, In this online interactive, see what her life was like in the ocean, find out how she got to her home in the Museum and get a behind-the-scenes peek of the Museum's collections.
