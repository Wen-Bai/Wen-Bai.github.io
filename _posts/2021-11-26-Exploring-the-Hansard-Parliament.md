This week’s expedition is to Hansard
• Hansard is the official record of UK parliamentary debates
• Every word that has been said in every parliamentary debate since 1909 is
recorded in Hansard
• Hansard also covers many (but not all) debates from before then, dating back to
1803

• Your task is to write 250 words on your blog answering this question:
• What kinds of research could people do using the information in Hansard as a resource?
• How well does the Hansard website facilitate those kinds of research?
